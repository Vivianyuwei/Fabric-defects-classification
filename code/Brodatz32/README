Detailed information:
Type of problem:		texture classification
Number of texture classes:	32 textures from the Brodatz album
Number of images (samples):	64 images per class (hence 2048 images in
				total), which comprise following subsets
				of images:
				16 'original' images
				16 rotated versions of the 'original' images
				16 scaled versions of the 'original' images
				16 rotated and scaled versions of the
				   'original' images
Image size:			64x64 pixels
Image format:			xv (Khoros Visualization image file)
Pixel format:			8 bit monochrome
Preprocessing:			histogram equalization; each 64x64 sample has
				uniform gray level histogram

		<idx>		running index (0-15) corresponding to the 16
				'original' images

		<type>		o	original
				r 	rotated
				s	scaled
				rs	rotated and scaled
